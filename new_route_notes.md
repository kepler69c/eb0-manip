idea: get Super Bomb to kill The Fish in Magicent (OBSOLETE)

route:
- traditional route until Merrysville
- buy 3 Breads then go to Duncan's (manip)
- after Duncan's factory, use Bread in front of train - second Bread (first was used to go out of Duncan's)
- get cactus melody
- get Teleportation at Youngstown
- manip all the levels at Mt. Itoi + Super Bomb
- death warp Mt. Itoi -> Magicant
- place Bread in Loid's slots, and use it in front of riddle
- beat dragon
- Teleport to shop, buy foods
- after foods, use Ninten's Crumbs
- pay train to Spookane, after train, trigger Spookane's zone and Tp to it (whoaa)
- get mansion's melody
- use Loid's Crumbs
- destroy game

maybe, try extend the manip after death wrap ? even tough it's fine if it fails (it might be a timeloss though, if TP is faster)
