idea: get Super Bomb to kill The Fish in Magicent (OBSOLETE)

how? 2 possibilities:
1 (probably worthless):
- Save in Magicant - manip starts (or continue previous manip)
- Super Bomb can be bought to the chemistry lab located at Merrysville, item costs 1800$
- get Boomerang in Magicant's Queen Mary's castle - 550$
- selling  Rope from Zoo - 300$
- ? selling Slingshot - 60$
2: extend manip to the end of universe, save in Magicant and death warp back to Magicant when the run is almost done, bruh
two possibilities:
1 death warp at Mt. Itoi
  use Bread in front of riddle (this requires Bread from Zoo)
  beat dragon
  Teleport to Spookane, get the melody
  Teleport to shop, get food
  use crumbs
  end the game
2 Teleport to shop, get Bread and foods
  Teleport to Spookane
  get melody
  death warp here (if possible)
  use Bread  in front of riddle
  beat dragon
  use crumbs
  beat the game
3 (theoritical Teleport skip) IS NOT POSSIBLE NOW I NEED IDEAS
  keep train Crumbs (on Ninten) at Youngstown
  manip until lv25 (get Super Bomb & not useless PSI Stone)
  get the melodies
  ARRRGHH
  1 death warp Mt. Itoi (manip)
    get money from fontain
    Loid uses Bread in front of riddle (requires Zoo's Bread) (keep manip)
    beat dragon (forget manip?)
    use Ninten's Crumbs
    train to Spookane
    get melody
    use Loid's Crumbs
    finish game
  2 use crumbs
    apziojdaizehaozeu
  
it will depend on what is the fastest to death warp at (with manip or not)

forget above, good route:
- traditional route until Merrysville
- buy 3 Breads then go to Duncan's (manip)
- after Duncan's factory, use Bread in front of train - second Bread (first was used to go out of Duncan's)
- get cactus melody
- get Teleportation at Youngstown
- manip all the levels at Mt. Itoi + Super Bomb
- death warp Mt. Itoi -> Magicant
- place Bread in Loid's slots, and use it in front of riddle
- beat dragon
- Teleport to shop, buy foods
- after foods, use Ninten's Crumbs
- pay train to Spookane, after train, trigger Spookane's zone and Tp to it (whoaa)
- get mansion's melody
- use Loid's Crumbs
- destroy game

maybe, try extend the manip after death wrap ? even tough it's fine if it fails (it might be a timeloss though, if TP is faster)
